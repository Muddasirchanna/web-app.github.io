               <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;Welcome to the world of Blockchain</p>

                  <p><b>Blockchain is an immutable, distributed, decentralized; peer-to-peer ledger <br>replicated across multiple nodes connected in a network, making it <br>possible to record data about any event or transaction as it happens. It <br>consists of blocks in a chain used to record as digital assets using a secure<br> algorithm.</b></p>

                       <p><b>Where can we apply Blockchain technology?</b></p>
    
                     <ul>
                        <li><b>Food Safety:</b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/walmart-is-betting-on-the-blockchain-to-improve-food-safety/">Walmart</a>
                            is working with IBM for enhanced tracking and <br> traceability of food products, resulting in better food safety.

                        <li><b>
                            Real Estate Title Issuance:</b>title registry system uses blockchain to make <br> title issuance instantaneous.</li>
                            <li><b>
                                Money Transfer from anywhere to anywhere on the globe:</b>The global <br> money transfer is time-consuming, error-prone, costly, and subjected to <br> money laundering. The secure, immutable, decentralized, and <br> transparency feature of Blockchain helps solve money transfer issues <br> without any intermediary.</li>
                     </ul>
    
    
                         <p>Blockchain can be applied to many other applications wherever we want to <br> record transactions securely between two parties without an intermediary.</p>
                         <p><i><b>How is a Blockchain ledger different from a database? Are the two not the same <br> used for recording, organizing, monitoring, and controlling information?</b></i></p>
                         <p>Database and Blockchain both record transactions, but <b>the database is <br> centralized and has a single point of failure. In contrast, the Blockchain is <br> decentralized and distributed on multiple nodes across the network.</b></p>          
     
                         <p><b>Databases are owned by a central authority,</b> a company, or a government <br> institution, which <b>controls access</b> by granting different roles to different <br> users. Whereas <b>Blockchain is a peer-to-peer network where each node can <br> connect with every other node, and blocks in a chain are connected using a <br> secure cryptographic protocol like SHA-256.</b></p>
                        <h5>Ledger</h5>
                        <h5>A ledger records transactions such as recording payments, supply chain <br> details, medical records, real-estate contracts, etc.</h5>
                        <h5>SHA-256</h5>
                        <p><b>SHA-256 is a cryptographic algorithm that accepts input of any length,<br> scrambles the data deterministically, and returns a hash that is 256 bits or 64 <br> characters long.</b>SHA-256 hashing algorithm ensures the input can never<br> be derived from the output, making it very secure.</p>

    <p><b>A Block header in a Blockchain contains the following attributes</b></p>
                        <ol>
        <Li><b>Version number</b> to track the software or protocol that will allow other <br> computers to read the block correctly.
        </Li>
    
    
        <li><b>Timestamp:</b>when the transaction was recorded, or the block was created <br> and is expressed as seconds since 1970–01–01T00:00 UTC.
        </li>
    
    
        <li><b>256 bit Cryptographic hash of the previous block </b> header that links one <br> block with another block in a Blockchain. This ensures the integrity of <br> the previous block all the way back to the first block referred to as a <br> Genesis block.</li>
    
    
        <li><b>Nonce </b> stands for <b> number only used once. The nonce is a randomly <br> generated number that miners generate to solve a complex <br> mathematical problem to create a block.
        </b></li>
    
    
    <li><b>The target represents the difficulty of generating the nonce, which <br> validates a transaction before it is added to a blockchain.</b> It regulates the <br> speed at which new blocks are added to the blockchain and are adjusted <br> roughly every 2016 block. Higher difficulty in generating the nonce <br> represents a lower target value.</li>
    
    <li><b>Merkle root hash</b> for all the transactions in a block.</li>
